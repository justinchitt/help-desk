# Reason for the project: 
   This project was built in order to apply and showcase the skills I have learned and developed during our phase three training at the Software Engineering Live class - Flatiron Bootcamp (class of 09/21). These skills major in my use of JavaScript and React to manipulate and change the DOM, and also the use of HTML and CSS to develop and design webpages. To create a backend API for my application, I utilized Ruby on Rails to create CRUD responses, Activerecord to make SQL commands, and Ruby to create classes and endpoints.

# Project Description: 
    myHelpDesk was created to solve the problem of communicating with an IT specialist or senior developer at a company. With myHelpDesk, the process is more efficient and organized. Upon signup, a user will receive an email welcoming them to the application. With myHelpDesk, a user can submit a ticket to an admin and view all their tickets and their status. The admin can claim a ticket and respond to the ticket with a solution or an action that they have taken to solve that problem. Also, the user can delete their tickets. Both user and admins can edit their account information.

# Technologies Used:

# Learnings and Struggles:
    While creating this app, I got a better understanding of sessions. Also, since this project was a solo one, I was forced to learn more about flex boxes in CSS. I also struggled with CSS.
  
# Acknowledgments:
    I used numerous resources both from our curriculum and those available for free online. These allowed us to expand our knowledge and practice many new skills.
